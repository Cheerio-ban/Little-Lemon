          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned
            Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with
            a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and
            Turkish culture and have a menu of 12â€“15 items that they rotate
            seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
            moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of
            the day. Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and
            Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream
            of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family
            recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
            marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu
            beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the
            Mediterranean region.
